I was recently looking for a way to estimate power consumption in [Home Assistant](https://www.home-assistant.io/docs/energy/) without buying any additional hardware. I already have a Kill-A-Watt, so it's easy to just go around and start collecting data for 24/7 devices and devices with on/off states in Home Assistant.

[PowerCalc](https://github.com/bramstroker/homeassistant-powercalc) ties this data together with an easy to use integration.

### Intro ‚ö°

So why am I doing all this? First I want to shout out the amazing developers behind [HydroQC](https://hydroqc.ca/en/) which brings in data from Hydro-Quebec directly into Home Assistant. It's much faster, and updates more regularly vs Hydro's own website. Our Landis+Gyr Gridsream RF meters seemingly have a Zigbee radio inside, but it's disabled ‚òπÔ∏è

So with this data in Home Assistant what more could I ask for? I want to know which devices are contributing to the totals I get from Hydro-Quebec. 

That's where [PowerCalc](https://github.com/bramstroker/homeassistant-powercalc) comes in. It creates virtual power sensors with your own data, or from their library.

### 24/7 Devices üîå

For devices that are always on like your home network, you can create a **Daily Energy** sensor. 

**Network**
- Value: 50
- Unit: W
- Defaults to 1 day

I measured each device like my router, access points, switches, etc. I keep track of them in a spreadsheet so I can create a total value for the network power sensor.

For appliances that cycle on and off like a refrigerator, connect it to your Kill-A-Watt and measure over several days to calculate an average power. The more hours you measure, the more accurate it will be. For example 12 kWh / 48 Hours = 0.25 kW.

### Static loads with on/off states in Home Assistant üí°

For example a smart light switch with 8x 4 Watt LED bulbs.

**Virtual Power (manual)**\
Source Entity: switch.living_room

**Fixed Config**\
Power: 4

**Advanced options**\
Multiply Factor: 8

### Gaming PC with Steam üéÆ

I wanted to try something more advanced, how much power is my PC using, and how much more when I'm playing a game.

First I set up [Wake on LAN](https://www.home-assistant.io/integrations/wake_on_lan/) to get the on/off state for my PC. You could also use the [Ping](https://www.home-assistant.io/integrations/ping/) integration.

```yaml
wake_on_lan:

switch:
  - platform: wake_on_lan
    mac: AA:BB:CC:DD:EE:FF
    name: PC
    host: 10.0.0.200
```

Then I hooked up my PC to a Kill-A-Watt and measured power consumption under normal use, and to make it more interesting, I tested in different games. 

With the [Steam](https://www.home-assistant.io/integrations/steam_online/) integration you can easily create a **Power Template** in PowerCalc to map games to different power levels.

**Power Template**

```yaml
{% if is_state_attr('sensor.steam_user', 'game', 'BattleBit Remastered') %}
  300
{% elif is_state_attr('sensor.sensor.steam_user', 'game', 'Counter-Strike 2') %}
  385
{% elif is_state_attr('sensor.sensor.steam_user', 'game', 'Microsoft Flight Simulator') %}
  385
{% elif is_state_attr('sensor.sensor.steam_user', 'game', 'Aimlabs') %}
  120
{% elif state_attr('sensor.sensor.steam_user', 'game') is not none %} # All other games
  350
{% else %}
  85
{% endif %}
```

You can also use the WoL sensor to trigger other fixed power devices like displays and other peripherals.

### Heat Pump ü•∂

For heat pumps you can get a rough estimate of the power consumption by using the following formula:

BTU √∑ SEER = Watts

For example 24,000 BTU √∑ 10 SEER = 2400 Watts

If you have a smart thermostat you can easily trigger off that, or else you need to set up a temperature sensor and some helpers. You could also trigger off a light sensor if your machine turns on an LED when it's running.

Set up a [**Derivative**](https://www.home-assistant.io/integrations/derivative/) helper to watch a temperature sensor placed on a register reporting every minute. My settings are Precision: 2, Time Window: 2 minutes, Time Unit: Minutes.

Then set up a [**Template Binary Sensor**](https://www.home-assistant.io/integrations/template/) helper with the following template:

```yaml
{% if states('sensor.vent_derivative') | float <= -0.25 %} # On when temp drops -0.25 C / minute
  on
{% elif states('sensor.vent_derivative') | float >= 0.25 %} # Off when temp increases 0.25 C / minute
  off
{% elif states('sensor.vent_temperature') | float <= 16 %} # Steady state, hold on
  on
{% else %} 
  off
{% endif %}
```

You may have to tweak this for your own HVAC system.

Come back in 6 months when I have to modify this for the winter to see how to actually do this properly üòâ

It requires some additional logic to account for defrost cycles that I need live data to test with.

Honestly just buy a smart thermostat or see if your system has an LED you can attach a light sensor to and avoid all this nonsense. For an accurate reading there are current clamps you could use instead. 

### Final Thoughts

‚ö°[PowerCalc](https://github.com/bramstroker/homeassistant-powercalc) is a fantastic addition to Home Assistant, I wish I heard about it sooner. I'm looking for other ways to integrate stuff like my washer, dryer, hot water heater, etc, but I think current clamp sensors might be more realistic. And Hydro-Quebec gives me hourly data anyways so is it really necessary to go through the hassle.
