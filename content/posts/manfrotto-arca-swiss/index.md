I was looking for a small tabletop tripod when I discovered pretty much all of them are using Arca-Swiss style quick release plates now. It seems like an interesting system, so I wanted to try it out on my trusty Manfrotto 055  Ball Head. I quickly learned Manfrotto clamps are custom and you need to use a small adapter boss to convert the Manfrotto anti-twist into a standard anti-twist post.

There are a few brands making these adapters:
- iShoot IS-5275JX (This is what I got, the Manfrotto stem part is a little too slim)
- Sunwayfoto  MAP-02
- Haoge Female to Male Boss Adapter
- Desmond DBAD

For the clamp I wanted something that looks nice and wouldn't look out of place. I discovered the very good looking and well machined **Leofoto LHC-60**. The clamp feels super high quality. The finish feels really premium, and the knob is knurled perfectly. A 70mm quick release plate is included with a split ring to tighten the screw if you don't have a screwdriver in the field. 

I'm really happy with the clamp. I'm certainly interested in trying some of their other gear.

Looks pretty nice doesn't it.

Now back to my search for a compact tabletop tripod ðŸ˜ƒ
