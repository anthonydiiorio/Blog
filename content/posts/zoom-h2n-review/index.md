The Zoom H2n is a versatile recorder that has served me well since 2012. I've used it to make field recordings, voice overs, and even for ham radio recordings during satellite passes. 

## Review

The Zoom H2n can record from it's five capsules in four modes:

- XY: 90° Stereo XY pattern
- Mid-Side: Front facing and 2ch side capsule with adjustable pattern or raw recording. (default 0dB = 120°)
- 2 Channel Surround: 360 recording from the XY and MS capsules
- 4 Channel Surround: Split files from the XY and MS capsules

The H2n can record at up to 24bit/96kHz in WAV or MP3 from the internal microphones or an external input. The H2n comes with a 4 GB SD card, but if you plan on recording 24bit/96kHz WAV files, I suggest using a larger capacity card.

You can monitor your audio with the headphone jack and the onboard VU meter. I try to keep my recordings peaking under -12 dB so there's some headroom available.

There are some onboard DSP effects like an 80 Hz low cut filter, limiter, and compressor. I don't recommend using these because they are applied after the analog to digital converter and won't stop your signal from clipping. The clipping light still flashes, but the VU meter shows the limited level being recorded. This can make setting levels confusing and gives a false sense of security because you aren't seeing the real levels hitting the ADC.

I also occasionally use the onboard USB audio interface which comes in extremely handy.

I've had great success using this microphone to make field recordings, voice overs, ham radio recordings, digitizing analog media, and more. 

## Conclusion

Overall I've been fairly impressed with the audio from the H2n. It's been really handy for a number of projects, and it's paid itself off time and time again. If you're in the market for a small, affordable field recorder with an interesting array of microphone configurations, the H2n is an incredible value.

## 2021 Update

Holy moly I've had this thing for a while and it's held up quite well. I had one issue after repeated use of the line in port. A solder joint cracked which caused a weird distortion after unplugging an external source. It was a very easy repair, I just reflowed the solder on that connector. The H2n comes apart easily.
