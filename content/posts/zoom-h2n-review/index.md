I've had the Zoom H2n for around 6 months now, and I think it's time for a review. You may not have noticed, but a lot of the videos up on my YouTube channel are recorded using this microphone before I got my [EV RE27/nd](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bza598PjIKw).

## Features

The H2n has four capsules hidden under the head basket which allows the mic to have four modes of recording: Stereo XY, 2 or 4 Channel Surround, and Mid Side. Stereo XY acts in pretty much the same way both the H1 and H4n record sound. The 2 & 4 channel mode creates pretty neat 3D sound and records into two separate files for combining them in post production. Finally, the Mid Side Stereo mode records from the front of the H2n, and simultaneously records the two microphones on the left and right of the H2n.

The H2n can record at up to 24bit/96kHz in WAV or MP3 from either the internal microphones or an external line level/dynamic mic source. The H2n comes with a 4 GB SD card, but if you plan on recording at 24bit/96kHz in WAV the card will fill up pretty quickly. I suggest using at least a 16 GB card so you don't run out of space while on location without a computer to offload data to.

One of the great features of this mic that you'll also find on most field recorders is the built in headphone jack and VU meter on the display. These features allow you to make sure you're not clipping which in turn results in a clean piece of audio. On top of that Zoom also included built in compression and limiting presets to further prevent clipping. Unfortunately you can't manually set the compression/limiter settings which is a real pain if you actually know what you're doing. Besides that, there's also an auto gain control and a lo cut filter which I haven't tried yet.


## In Practice

Besides using this mic for recording audio for my [YouTube](http://youtube.com/thetechzonelive) videos, I've also used it to record samples, amateur radio recodings, and some freelance video projects. When it comes time to edit you just need to align the audio tracks with scratch audio from the camera.

One of the things I actually dislike on the H2n is the glossy piano black finish. It gets loaded with finger prints and scratches. I just despise glossy plastic, it's almost as bad as rubberized or soft touch plastic.


## Conclusion

Overall I've been fairly impressed with the audio from the H2n. It's been really handy for a number of projects, and it's paid itself off time and time again. So if you're in the market for a small, affordable, and highly configurable field recorder, the H2n is an incredible value. You can find it on [Amazon: Zoom H2n](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B005CQ2ZY6/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&tag=ttzl-20&linkCode=as2&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=B005CQ2ZY6)

*Note: The H2n can't provide 48v phantom power, only plug power for lav mics.

## 2021 Update

Holy moly I've had this thing for a while and it's mostly held up. I had one issue after repeated use of the line in port. A solder joint cracked which caused a weird distortion after unplugging an external source. It was a very easy repair, I just reflowed the solder on that connector. The H2n comes apart easily.
